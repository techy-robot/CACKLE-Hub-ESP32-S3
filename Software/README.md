# Software

This is based on [Luos Engine](https://www.luos.io/), a lightweight distributed communication engine that aims to make hardware as modular as software. 

Most of the code found here are luos node definitions and driver services for the of the hardware modules, designed to be easily reusable in your project. There are also some tests and example code.
